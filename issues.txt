User Story #1. Theft. A students Id card can always be stolen and use as if a credit card was stolen.
The best way to prevent this is all Id card to be pin-based only.  Using the card requires a pincode.

User Story #2. Database.  Adding all students to new database will be time consuming because not all students currently have id cards or use student account to pay for food and supplies.
This new database will not only include student info registar already has but now credit card information added to it.
Possible solution is to have a credit card link to student's id right at the start of acceptance to the school.
Keep a separate database with extra encryption in case of a school data breach.

User  Story #3. Encryption.  There are plenty of programs to reverse engineer hash code  encrytions.
The school will have to invest in a top of the line encrytion saoftware to ensure maximum protection for its students
Solution is the have a hash program with salt to make it harder to decrypt the hash.
